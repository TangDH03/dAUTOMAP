AUTOMAP is a promising generalized reconstruction approach, however, it is not scalable and hence the practicality is limited. We present a novel way for decomposing the domain transformation, which makes the model scale linearly with the input size. We show the proposed method, termed dAUTOMAP, outperforms AUTOMAP with significantly fewer parameters.

The abstract was presented as an oral presentation during the Scientific Session: "Machine Learning for Image Reconstruction" at ISMRM2019 (https://www.ismrm.org/19/program_files/O49.htm).

This repository contains the code for dAUTOMAP.
